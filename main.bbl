    Abstract Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique
  that analyzes a data table in which observations are described by several
  inter-correlated quantitative dependent variables. Its goal is to extract the
  important information from the table, to represent it as a set of new
  orthogonal variables called principal components, and to display the pattern
  of similarity of the observations and of the variables as points in maps. The
  quality of the PCA model can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques
  such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. PCA can be generalized as
  correspondence analysis (CA) in order to handle qualitative variables and as
  multiple factor analysis (MFA) in order to handle heterogeneous sets of
  variables. Mathematically, PCA depends upon the eigen-decomposition of
  positive semi-definite matrices and upon the singular value decomposition
  (SVD) of rectangular matrices. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

    Requirement of large annotated datasets restrict the use of deep
  convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for many practical applications. The
  problem can be mitigated by using active learning (AL) techniques which,
  under a given annotation budget, allow to select a subset of data that yields
  maximum accuracy upon fine tuning. State of the art AL approaches typically
  rely on measures of visual diversity or prediction uncertainty, which are
  unable to effectively capture the variations in spatial context. On the other
  hand, modern CNN architectures make heavy use of spatial context for
  achieving highly accurate predictions. Since the context is difficult to
  evaluate in the absence of ground-truth labels, we introduce the notion of
  contextual diversity that captures the confusion associated with spatially
  co-occurring classes. Contextual Diversity (CD) hinges on a crucial
  observation that the probability vector predicted by a CNN for a region of
  interest typically contains information from a larger receptive field.
  Exploiting this observation, we use the proposed CD measure within two AL
  frameworks: (1) a core-set based strategy and (2) a reinforcement learning
  based policy, for active frame selection. Our extensive empirical evaluation
  establish state of the art results for active learning on benchmark datasets
  of Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection and Image classification. Our
  ablation studies show clear advantages of using contextual diversity for
  active learning. The source code and additional results are available at
  https://github.com/sharat29ag/CDAL.%

    This article surveys reinforcement learning approaches in social robotics.
  Reinforcement learning is a framework for decision-making problems in which
  an agent interacts through trial-and-error with its environment to discover
  an optimal behavior. Since interaction is a key component in both
  reinforcement learning and social robotics, it can be a well-suited approach
  for real-world interactions with physically embodied social robots. The scope
  of the paper is focused particularly on studies that include social physical
  robots and real-world human-robot interactions with users. We present a
  thorough analysis of reinforcement learning approaches in social robotics. In
  addition to a survey, we categorize existent reinforcement learning
  approaches based on the used method and the design of the reward mechanisms.
  Moreover, since communication capability is a prominent feature of social
  robots, we discuss and group the papers based on the communication medium
  used for reward formulation. Considering the importance of designing the
  reward function, we also provide a categorization of the papers based on the
  nature of the reward. This categorization includes three major themes:
  interactive reinforcement learning, intrinsically motivated methods, and task
  performance-driven methods. The benefits and challenges of reinforcement
  learning in social robotics, evaluation methods of the papers regarding
  whether or not they use subjective and algorithmic measures, a discussion in
  the view of real-world reinforcement learning challenges and proposed
  solutions, the points that remain to be explored, including the approaches
  that have thus far received less attention is also given in the paper. Thus,
  this paper aims to become a starting point for researchers interested in
  using and applying reinforcement learning methods in this particular research
  field.%

    Publisher Summary This chapter presents a basic method for automatically
  constructing decision trees from examples. It reviews various extensions of
  this basic procedure. The chapter provides a sample of real-world
  applications for which the decision tree learning approach has been shown to
  be successful. Considerable effort has been put to develop methods that
  induce the desired classification knowledge from a given set of
  pre-classified examples. Constructing classifiers in the form of decision
  trees has obtained much popularity. Decision trees have the advantage of
  being comprehensible by human experts and of being directly convertible into
  production rules. When used to handle a given case, a decision tree not only
  gives the solution for that case, but also mentions the reasons behind its
  choice. These features are very important in typical application domains in
  which human experts seek tools to help them in performing their job. Another
  advantage of using decision trees is the ease and efficiency of their
  construction compared to that of other classifiers such as neural networks.%

    The semantic image segmentation task consists of classifying each pixel of
  an image into an instance, where each instance corresponds to a class. This
  task is a part of the concept of scene understanding or better explaining the
  global context of an image. In the medical image analysis domain, image
  segmentation can be used for image-guided interventions, radiotherapy, or
  improved radiological diagnostics. In this review, we categorize the leading
  deep learning-based medical and non-medical image segmentation solutions into
  six main groups of deep architectural, data synthesis-based, loss
  function-based, sequenced models, weakly supervised, and multi-task methods
  and provide a comprehensive review of the contributions in each of these
  groups. Further, for each group, we analyze each variant of these groups and
  discuss the limitations of the current approaches and present potential
  future research directions for semantic image segmentation.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    This chapter covers details of the support vector machine (SVM) technique,
  a sparse kernel decision machine that avoids computing posterior
  probabilities when building its learning model. SVM offers a principled
  approach to problems because of its mathematical foundation in statistical
  learning theory. SVM constructs its solution in terms of a subset of the
  training input. SVM has been extensively used for classification, regression,
  novelty detection tasks, and feature reduction. This chapter focuses on SVM
  for supervised classification tasks only, providing SVM formulations for when
  the input space is linearly separable or linearly nonseparable and when the
  data are unbalanced, along with examples. The chapter also presents recent
  improvements to and extensions of the original SVM formulation. A case study
  concludes the chapter.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In the near future, the communication between autonomous cars will produce
  a network of sensors that will allow us to know the state of the roads in
  real time. Lidar technology, upon which most autonomous cars are based,
  allows the acquisition of 3D geometric information of the environment. The
  objective of this work is to use point clouds acquired by Mobile Laser
  Scanning (MLS) to segment the main elements of road environment (road
  surface, ditches, guardrails, fences, embankments, and borders) through the
  use of PointNet. Previously, the point cloud was automatically divided into
  sections in order for semantic segmentation to be scalable to different case
  studies, regardless of their shape or length. An overall accuracy of 92.5{\%}
  has been obtained, but with large variations between classes. Elements with a
  greater number of points have been segmented more effectively than the other
  elements. In comparison with other point-by-point extraction and ANN-based
  classification techniques, the same success rates have been obtained for road
  surfaces and fences, and better results have been obtained for guardrails.
  Semantic segmentation with PointNet is suitable when segmenting the scene as
  a whole, however, if certain classes have more interest, there are other
  alternatives that do not need a high training cost.%

    Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for
  hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically
  that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter
  optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a
  comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual
  search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with
  neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search
  over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within
  a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same
  computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively
  searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep
  belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and
  grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration
  space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and
  superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the
  function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for
  most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that
  different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This
  phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new
  data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput"
  methods achieve surprising success--they appear to search through a large
  number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much.
  We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place
  an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this
  work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge
  progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter
  optimization algorithms.%

    Most models of utility elicitation in decision support and interactive
  optimization assume a predefined set of "catalog" features over which user
  preferences are expressed. However, users may differ in the features over
  which they are most comfortable expressing their preferences. In this work we
  consider the problem of feature elicitation: a user's utility function is
  expressed using features whose definitions (in terms of "catalog" features)
  are unknown. We cast this as a problem of concept learning, but whose goal is
  to identify only enough about the concept to enable a good decision to be
  recommended. We describe computational procedures for identifying optimal
  alternatives w.r.t. minimax regret in the presence of concept uncertainty;
  and describe several heuristic query strategies that focus on reduction of
  relevant concept uncertainty.%

    We introduce a new approach to modelling gradient flows of contours and
  surfaces. While standard variational methods (e.g. level sets) compute local
  interface motion in a differential fashion by estimating local contour
  velocity via energy derivatives, we propose to solve surface evolution PDEs
  by explicitly estimating integral motion of the whole surface. We formulate
  an optimization problem directly based on an integral characterization of
  gradient flow as an infinitesimal move of the (whole) surface giving the
  largest energy decrease among all moves of equal size. We show that this
  problem can be efficiently solved using recent advances in algorithms for
  global hypersurface optimization [4,2,11]. In particular, we employ the
  geo-cuts method [4] that uses ideas from integral geometry to represent
  continuous surfaces as cuts on discrete graphs. The resulting interface
  evolution algorithm is validated on some 2D and 3D examples similar to
  typical demonstrations of level-set methods. Our method can compute gradient
  flows of hypersurfaces with respect to a fairly general class of continuous
  functionals and it is flexible with respect to distance metrics on the space
  of contours/surfaces. Preliminary tests for standard L2 distance metric
  demonstrate numerical stability, topological changes and an absence of any
  oscillatory motion.%

    Bagging predictors is a method for generating multiple versions of a
  predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The aggregation
  averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a
  plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by
  making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new
  learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and
  regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging
  can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability
  of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause
  significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve
  accuracy.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Visual object analysis researchers are increasingly experimenting with
  video, because it is expected that motion cues should help with detection,
  recognition, and other analysis tasks. This paper presents the
  Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) as the first collection of
  videos with object class semantic labels, complete with metadata. The
  database provides ground truth labels that associate each pixel with one of
  32 semantic classes. The database addresses the need for experimental data to
  quantitatively evaluate emerging algorithms. While most videos are filmed
  with fixed-position CCTV-style cameras, our data was captured from the
  perspective of a driving automobile. The driving scenario increases the
  number and heterogeneity of the observed object classes. Over 10min of high
  quality 30Hz footage is being provided, with corresponding semantically
  labeled images at 1Hz and in part, 15Hz. The CamVid Database offers four
  contributions that are relevant to object analysis researchers. First, the
  per-pixel semantic segmentation of over 700 images was specified manually,
  and was then inspected and confirmed by a second person for accuracy. Second,
  the high-quality and large resolution color video images in the database
  represent valuable extended duration digitized footage to those interested in
  driving scenarios or ego-motion. Third, we filmed calibration sequences for
  the camera color response and intrinsics, and computed a 3D camera pose for
  each frame in the sequences. Finally, in support of expanding this or other
  databases, we present custom-made labeling software for assisting users who
  wish to paint precise class-labels for other images and videos. We evaluate
  the relevance of the database by measuring the performance of an algorithm
  from each of three distinct domains: multi-class object recognition,
  pedestrian detection, and label propagation.%

    The S{\o}rensen-Dice index (SDI) is a widely used measure for evaluating
  medical image segmentation algorithms. It offers a standardized measure of
  segmentation accuracy which has proven useful. However, it offers diminishing
  insight when the number of objects is unknown, such as in white matter lesion
  segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We present a refinement for
  finer grained parsing of SDI results in situations where the number of
  objects is unknown. We explore these ideas with two case studies showing what
  can be learned from our two presented studies. Our first study explores an
  inter-rater comparison, showing that smaller lesions cannot be reliably
  identified. In our second case study, we demonstrate fusing multiple MS
  lesion segmentation algorithms based on the insights into the algorithms
  provided by our analysis to generate a segmentation that exhibits improved
  performance. This work demonstrates the wealth of information that can be
  learned from refined analysis of medical image segmentations.%

    Large pose variations remain to be a challenge that confronts real-word
  face detection. We propose a new cascaded Convolutional Neural Network,
  dubbed the name Supervised Transformer Network, to address this challenge.
  The first stage is a multi-task Region Proposal Network (RPN), which
  simultaneously predicts candidate face regions along with associated facial
  landmarks. The candidate regions are then warped by mapping the detected
  facial landmarks to their canonical positions to better normalize the face
  patterns. The second stage, which is a RCNN, then verifies if the warped
  candidate regions are valid faces or not. We conduct end-to-end learning of
  the cascaded network, including optimizing the canonical positions of the
  facial landmarks. This supervised learning of the transformations
  automatically selects the best scale to differentiate face/non-face patterns.
  By combining feature maps from both stages of the network, we achieve
  state-of-the-art detection accuracies on several public benchmarks. For
  real-time performance, we run the cascaded network only on regions of
  interests produced from a boosting cascade face detector. Our detector runs
  at 30 FPS on a single CPU core for a VGA-resolution image.%

    Over the past decade, deep learning has achieved remarkable success in
  various artificial intelligence research areas. Evolved from the previous
  research on artificial neural networks, this technology has shown superior
  performance to other machine learning algorithms in areas such as image and
  voice recognition, natural language processing, among others. The first wave
  of applications of deep learning in pharmaceutical research has emerged in
  recent years, and its utility has gone beyond bioactivity predictions and has
  shown promise in addressing diverse problems in drug discovery. Examples will
  be discussed covering bioactivity prediction, de novo molecular design,
  synthesis prediction and biological image analysis.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    This paper proposes a concise and effective approach termed discriminative
  feature representation (DFR) for low dose computerized tomography (LDCT)
  image processing, which is currently a challenging problem in medical imaging
  field. This DFR method assumes LDCT images as the superposition of desirable
  high dose CT (HDCT) 3D features and undesirable noise-artifact 3D features
  (the combined term of noise and artifact features induced by low dose scan
  protocols), and the decomposed HDCT features are used to provide the
  processed LDCT images with higher quality. The target HDCT features are
  solved via the DFR algorithm using a featured dictionary composed by atoms
  representing HDCT features and noise-artifact features. In this study, the
  featured dictionary is efficiently built using physical phantom images
  collected from the same CT scanner as the target clinical LDCT images to
  process. The proposed DFR method also has good robustness in parameter
  setting for different CT scanner types. This DFR method can be directly
  applied to process DICOM formatted LDCT images, and has good applicability to
  current CT systems. Comparative experiments with abdomen LDCT data validate
  the good performance of the proposed approach.%

    A widely used approach for locating points on deformable objects is to
  generate feature response images for each point, then to fit a shape model to
  the response images. We demonstrate that Random Forest regression can be used
  to generate high quality response images quickly. Rather than using a
  generative or a discriminative model to evaluate each pixel, a regressor is
  used to cast votes for the optimal position. We show this leads to fast and
  accurate matching when combined with a statistical shape model. We evaluate
  the technique in detail, and compare with a range of commonly used
  alternatives on several different datasets. We show that the random forest
  regression method is significantly faster and more accurate than equivalent
  discriminative, or boosted regression based methods trained on the same
  data.%

    Thesupport-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group
  classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following
  idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature
  space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed.
  Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization
  ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network
  was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data
  can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable
  training data.%

    Random Forests were introduced by Leo Breiman [6] who was inspired by
  earlier work by Amit and Geman [2]. Although not obvious from the description
  in [6], Random Forests are an extension of Breiman's bagging idea [5] and
  were developed as a competitor to boosting. Random Forests can be used for
  either a categorical response variable, referred to in [6] as
  ``classification,'' or a continuous response, referred to as ``regression.''
  Similarly, the predictor variables can be either categorical or continuous.%

    Decision trees and logistic regression are two very popular algorithms in
  customer churn prediction with strong predictive performance and good
  comprehensibility. Despite these strengths, decision trees tend to have
  problems to handle linear relations between variables and logistic regression
  has difficulties with interaction effects between variables. Therefore a new
  hybrid algorithm, the logit leaf model (LLM), is proposed to better classify
  data. The idea behind the LLM is that different models constructed on
  segments of the data rather than on the entire dataset lead to better
  predictive performance while maintaining the comprehensibility from the
  models constructed in the leaves. The LLM consists of two stages: a
  segmentation phase and a prediction phase. In the first stage customer
  segments are identified using decision rules and in the second stage a model
  is created for every leaf of this tree. This new hybrid approach is
  benchmarked against decision trees, logistic regression, random forests and
  logistic model trees with regards to the predictive performance and
  comprehensibility. The area under the receiver operating characteristics
  curve (AUC) and top decile lift (TDL) are used to measure the predictive
  performance for which LLM scores significantly better than its building
  blocks logistic regression and decision trees and performs at least as well
  as more advanced ensemble methods random forests and logistic model trees.
  Comprehensibility is addressed by a case study for which we observe some key
  benefits using the LLM compared to using decision trees or logistic
  regression.%

    The objectness measure is a significant and effective method used for
  generic object detection. However, several object detection methods can
  achieve accurate results by using more than 1000 candidate object proposals.
  In addition, the weight of each proposal is weak and also cannot distinguish
  object proposals. These weak proposals have brought difficulties to the
  subsequent analysis. To significantly reduce the number of proposals, this
  paper presents an improved generic object detection approach, which predicts
  candidate object proposals from more than 10,000 proposals. All candidate
  proposals can be divided, rather than preclassified, into three categories:
  entire object, partial object, and nonobject. These partial object proposals
  also display fragmentary information of the objectness feature, which can be
  used to reconstruct the object boundary. By using partial objectness to
  enhance the weight of the entire object proposals, we removed a huge number
  of useless proposals and reduced the space occupied by the true positive
  object proposals. We designed a neural network with lightweight computation
  to cluster the most possible object proposals with rerank and box regression.
  Through joint training, the lightweight network can share the features with
  other subsequent tasks. The proposed method was validated using experiments
  with the PASCAL VOC2007 dataset. The results showed that the proposed
  approach was significantly improved compared with the existing methods and
  can accurately detect 92.3{\%} of the objects by using less than 200
  proposals.%

    Despite significant successes achieved in knowledge discovery, traditional
  machine learning methods may fail to obtain satisfactory performances when
  dealing with complex data, such as imbalanced, high-dimensional, noisy data,
  etc. The reason behind is that it is difficult for these methods to capture
  multiple characteristics and underlying structure of data. In this context,
  it becomes an important topic in the data mining field that how to
  effectively construct an efficient knowledge discovery and mining model.
  Ensemble learning, as one research hot spot, aims to integrate data fusion,
  data modeling, and data mining into a unified framework. Specifically,
  ensemble learning firstly extracts a set of features with a variety of
  transformations. Based on these learned features, multiple learning
  algorithms are utilized to produce weak predictive results. Finally, ensemble
  learning fuses the informative knowledge from the above results obtained to
  achieve knowledge discovery and better predictive performance via voting
  schemes in an adaptive way. In this paper, we review the research progress of
  the mainstream approaches of ensemble learning and classify them based on
  different characteristics. In addition, we present challenges and possible
  research directions for each mainstream approach of ensemble learning, and we
  also give an extra introduction for the combination of ensemble learning with
  other machine learning hot spots such as deep learning, reinforcement
  learning, etc.%

    Active Learning methods rely on static strategies for sampling unlabeled
  point(s). These strategies range from uncertainty sampling and density
  estimation to multi-factor methods with learn-once-use-always model
  parameters. This paper proposes a dynamic approach, called DUAL, where the
  strategy selection parameters are adaptively updated based on estimated
  future residual error reduction after each actively sampled point. The
  objective of dual is to outperform static strategies over a large operating
  range: from very few to very many labeled points. Empirical results over six
  datasets demonstrate that DUAL outperforms several state-of-the-art methods
  on most datasets.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In general, most of the existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
  deep-learning models suffer from spatial-information loss and inadequate
  feature-representation issues. This is due to their inability to capture
  multiscale-context information and the exclusion of semantic information
  throughout the pooling operations. In the early layers of a CNN, the network
  encodes simple semantic representations, such as edges and corners, while, in
  the latter part of the CNN, the network encodes more complex semantic
  features, such as complex geometric shapes. Theoretically, it is better for a
  CNN to extract features from different levels of semantic representation
  because tasks such as classification and segmentation work better when both
  simple and complex feature maps are utilized. Hence, it is also crucial to
  embed multiscale capability throughout the network so that the various scales
  of the features can be optimally captured to represent the intended task.
  Multiscale representation enables the network to fuse low-level and
  high-level features from a restricted receptive field to enhance the
  deep-model performance. The main novelty of this review is the comprehensive
  novel taxonomy of multiscale-deep-learning methods, which includes details of
  several architectures and their strengths that have been implemented in the
  existing works. Predominantly, multiscale approaches in deep-learning
  networks can be classed into two categories: multiscale feature learning and
  multiscale feature fusion. Multiscale feature learning refers to the method
  of deriving feature maps by examining kernels over several sizes to collect a
  larger range of relevant features and predict the input images' spatial
  mapping. Multiscale feature fusion uses features with different resolutions
  to find patterns over short and long distances, without a deep network.
  Additionally, several examples of the techniques are also discussed according
  to their applications in satellite imagery, medical imaging, agriculture, and
  industrial and manufacturing systems.%

    The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge consists of two
  components: (i) a publicly available dataset of images together with ground
  truth annotation and standardised evaluation software; and (ii) an annual
  competition and workshop. There are five challenges: classification,
  detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this
  paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008--2012. The paper is
  intended for two audiences: algorithm designers, researchers who want to see
  what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the VOC datasets,
  along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation of
  algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers
  have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of
  future challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the
  VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a
  bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance
  of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so
  that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of
  positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance
  across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be
  identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms
  in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also
  analyse the community's progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et
  al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify
  the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the
  aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved
  in future challenges.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Despite the great empirical success of deep reinforcement learning, its
  theoretical foundation is less well understood. In this work, we make the
  first attempt to theoretically understand the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm
  (Mnih et al., 2015) from both algorithmic and statistical perspectives. In
  specific, we focus on the fitted Q iteration (FQI) algorithm with deep neural
  networks, which is a slight simplification of DQN that captures the tricks of
  experience replay and target network used in DQN. Under mild assumptions, we
  establish the algorithmic and statistical rates of convergence for the
  action-value functions of the iterative policy sequence obtained by FQI. In
  particular, the statistical error characterizes the bias and variance that
  arise from approximating the action-value function using deep neural network,
  while the algorithmic error converges to zero at a geometric rate. As a
  byproduct, our analysis provides justifications for the techniques of
  experience replay and target network, which are crucial to the empirical
  success of DQN. Furthermore, as a simple extension of DQN, we propose the
  Minimax-DQN algorithm for zero-sum Markov game with two players, which is
  deferred to the appendix due to space limitations.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine
  learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture
  model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically
  grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a
  prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical
  framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as
  approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of
  this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs –
  extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far.
  This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning
  without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We
  perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty.
  Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of
  regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a
  considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to
  existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout’s
  uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.%

    Image semantic segmentation is more and more being of interest for computer
  vision and machine learning researchers. Many applications on the rise need
  accurate and efficient segmentation mechanisms: autonomous driving, indoor
  navigation, and even virtual or augmented reality systems to name a few. This
  demand coincides with the rise of deep learning approaches in almost every
  field or application target related to computer vision, including semantic
  segmentation or scene understanding. This paper provides a review on deep
  learning methods for semantic segmentation applied to various application
  areas. Firstly, we formulate the semantic segmentation problem and define the
  terminology of this field as well as interesting background concepts. Next,
  the main datasets and challenges are exposed to help researchers decide which
  are the ones that best suit their needs and goals. Then, existing methods are
  reviewed, highlighting their contributions and their significance in the
  field. We also devote a part of the paper to review common loss functions and
  error metrics for this problem. Finally, quantitative results are given for
  the described methods and the datasets in which they were evaluated,
  following up with a discussion of the results. At last, we point out a set of
  promising future works and draw our own conclusions about the state of the
  art of semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Feature representation is generally applied to reducing the dimensions of
  high-dimensional data to accelerate the process of data handling and enhance
  the performance of pattern recognition. However, the dimensionality of data
  nowadays appears to be a rapidly increasing trend. Existing unsupervised
  feature representation methods are susceptible to the rapidly increasing
  dimensionality of data, which may result in learning a meaningless feature
  that in turn affect their performance in other applications. In this paper,
  an unsupervised adversarial auto-encoder network is studied. This network is
  a probability model that combines generative adversarial networks and
  variational auto-encoder to perform variational inference and aims to
  generate reconstructed data similar to original data as much as possible. Due
  to its adversarial training, this model is relatively robust in feature
  learning compared with other methods. First, the architecture and training
  strategy of adversarial auto-encoder are presented. We attempt to learn a
  discriminative feature representation for high-dimensional image data via
  adversarial auto-encoder and take its advantage into image clustering, which
  has become a difficult computer vision task recently. Then amounts of
  comparative experiments are carried out. The comparison contains eight
  feature representation methods and two recently proposed deep clustering
  methods performed on eight different publicly available image data sets.
  Finally, to evaluate their performance, we utilize a K-means clustering on
  the low-dimensional feature learned from each feature representation
  algorithm, and select three evaluation metrics including clustering accuracy,
  adjusted rand index and normalized mutual information, to provide a
  comparison. Comprehensive experiments prove the usefulness of the learned
  discriminative feature via adversarial auto-encoder in the tested data sets.%

    Object detection or localization is an incremental step in progression from
  coarse to fine digital image inference. It not only provides the classes of
  the image objects, but also provides the location of the image objects which
  have been classified. The location is given in the form of bounding boxes or
  centroids. Semantic segmentation gives fine inference by predicting labels
  for every pixel in the input image. Each pixel is labelled according to the
  object class within which it is enclosed. Furthering this evolution, instance
  segmentation gives different labels for separate instances of objects
  belonging to the same class. Hence, instance segmentation may be defined as
  the technique of simultaneously solving the problem of object detection as
  well as that of semantic segmentation. In this survey paper on instance
  segmentation, its background, issues, techniques, evolution, popular
  datasets, related work up to the state of the art and future scope have been
  discussed. The paper provides valuable information for those who want to do
  research in the field of instance segmentation.%

    The integration of technology in clinical care is growing rapidly and has
  become especially relevant during the global COVID-19 pandemic.
  Smartphone-based digital phenotyping, or the use of integrated sensors to
  identify patterns in behavior and symptomatology, has shown potential in
  detecting subtle moment-to-moment changes. These changes, often referred to
  as anomalies, represent significant deviations from an individual's baseline,
  may be useful in informing the risk of relapse in serious mental illness. Our
  investigation of smartphone-based anomaly detection resulted in 89{\%}
  sensitivity and 75{\%} specificity for predicting relapse in schizophrenia.
  These results demonstrate the potential of longitudinal collection of
  real-time behavior and symptomatology via smartphones and the clinical
  utility of individualized analysis. Future studies are necessary to explore
  how specificity can be improved, just-in-time adaptive interventions
  utilized, and clinical integration achieved.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry is
  experiencing a technological revolution driven by booming digitisation and
  automation. Advances in research fields of information technology and
  computer science, such as building information modelling (BIM), machine
  learning and computer vision have attracted growing attention owing to their
  useful applications. At the same time, population-driven underground
  development has been accelerated with digital transformation as a strategic
  imperative. Urban underground infrastructures are valuable assets and thus
  demanding effective planning, construction and maintenance. While enabling
  greater visibility and reliability into the processes and subsystems of
  underground construction, applications of BIM, machine learning and computer
  vision in underground construction represent different sets of opportunities
  and challenges from their use in above-ground construction. Therefore, this
  paper aims to present the state-of-the-art development and future trends of
  BIM, machine learning, computer vision and their related technologies in
  facilitating the digital transition of tunnelling and underground
  construction. Section 1 presents the global demand for adopting these
  technologies. Section 2 introduces the related terminologies,
  standardisations and fundamentals. Section 3 reviews BIM in traditional and
  mechanised tunnelling and highlights the importance of integrating 3D
  geological modelling and geographic information system (GIS) databases with
  BIM. Section 4 examines the key applications of machine learning and computer
  vision at different stages of underground construction. Section 5 discusses
  the challenges and perspectives of existing research on leveraging these
  emerging technologies for escalating digitisation, automation and information
  integration throughout underground project lifecycle. Section 6 summarises
  the current state of development, identified gaps and future directions.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the
  distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the
  parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by
  requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and
  makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We
  refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem
  by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making
  normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the
  normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to
  use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and
  in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art
  image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy
  with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a
  significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we
  improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching
  4.82{\%} top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.%

    Machine learning addresses the question of how to build computers that
  improve automatically through experience. It is one of today’s most rapidly
  growing technical fields, lying at the intersection of computer science and
  statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence and data science.
  Recent progress in machine learning has been driven both by the development
  of new learning algorithms and theory and by the ongoing explosion in the
  availability of online data and low-cost computation. The adoption of
  data-intensive machine-learning methods can be found throughout science,
  technology and commerce, leading to more evidence-based decision-making
  across many walks of life, including health care, manufacturing, education,
  financial modeling, policing, and marketing.%

    Active learning has gained attention as a method to expedite the learning
  curve of classifiers. To this end, uncertainty sampling is a widely adopted
  strategy that selects instances closer to the decision boundary. However,
  uncertainty sampling alone may not be sufficient in batch active learning due
  to the redundancy of instances and its susceptibility to outliers. In this
  study, we utilize query-by-committee (QBC) for uncertainty and demonstrate
  that its performance can be improved by introducing diversity and density in
  instance utility. Test results show that uncertainty sampling by QBC can be
  significantly improved with diversity and density incorporated in instance
  selection. Furthermore, we investigate several distance measures for use in
  diversity and density and show that random forest dissimilarity can be an
  effective distance measure in batch active learning. The effects of the
  characteristics of the data on the results are also analyzed.%

    This paper proposes a novel method of semantic segmentation, consisting of
  modified dilated residual network, atrous pyramid pooling module, and
  backpropagation, that is applicable to augmented reality (AR). In the
  proposed method, the modified dilated residual network extracts a feature map
  from the original images and maintains spatial information. The atrous
  pyramid pooling module places convolutions in parallel and layers feature
  maps in a pyramid shape to extract objects occupying small areas in the
  image; these are converted into one channel using a 1 &times; 1 convolution.
  Backpropagation compares the semantic segmentation obtained through
  convolution from the final feature map with the ground truth provided by a
  database. Losses can be reduced by applying backpropagation to the modified
  dilated residual network to change the weighting. The proposed method was
  compared with other methods on the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 databases.
  The proposed method achieved accuracies of 82.8 and 89.8 mean intersection
  over union (mIOU) and frame rates of 61 and 64.3 frames per second (fps) for
  the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 databases, respectively. These results
  prove the applicability of the proposed method for implementing natural AR
  applications at actual speeds because the frame rate is greater than 60 fps.%

    Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple
  processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of
  abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in
  speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many
  other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers
  intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm
  to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used
  to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the
  previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in
  processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone
  light on sequential data such as text and speech.%

    Despite their superior performance, deep learning models often lack
  interpretability. In this paper, we explore the modeling of insightful
  relations between words, in order to understand and enhance predictions. To
  this effect, we propose the Self-Attention Network (SANet), a flexible and
  interpretable architecture for text classification. Experiments indicate that
  gains obtained by self-attention is task-dependent. For instance, experiments
  on sentiment analysis tasks showed an improvement of around 2{\%} when using
  self-attention compared to a baseline without attention, while topic
  classification showed no gain. Interpretability brought forward by our
  architecture highlighted the importance of neighboring word interactions to
  extract sentiment.%

    Neural network models have been widely used in the field of natural
  language processing (NLP). Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have the
  ability to process sequences of arbitrary length, are common methods for
  sequence modeling tasks. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is one kind of RNNs
  and has achieved remarkable performance in text classification. However, due
  to the high dimensionality and sparsity of text data, and to the complex
  semantics of the natural language, text classification presents difficult
  challenges. In order to solve the above problems, a novel and unified
  architecture which contains a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), attention
  mechanism and the convolutional layer is proposed in this paper. The proposed
  architecture is called attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory
  with convolution layer (AC-BiLSTM). In AC-BiLSTM, the convolutional layer
  extracts the higher-level phrase representations from the word embedding
  vectors and BiLSTM is used to access both the preceding and succeeding
  context representations. Attention mechanism is employed to give different
  focus to the information outputted from the hidden layers of BiLSTM. Finally,
  the softmax classifier is used to classify the processed context information.
  AC-BiLSTM is able to capture both the local feature of phrases as well as
  global sentence semantics. Experimental verifications are conducted on six
  sentiment classification datasets and a question classification dataset,
  including detailed analysis for AC-BiLSTM. The results clearly show that
  AC-BiLSTM outperforms other state-of-the-art text classification methods in
  terms of the classification accuracy.%

    The ongoing rapid expansion of the Internet greatly increases the necessity
  of effective recommender systems for filtering the abundant information.
  Extensive research for recommender systems is conducted by a broad range of
  communities including social and computer scientists, physicists, and
  interdisciplinary researchers. Despite substantial theoretical and practical
  achievements, unification and comparison of different approaches are lacking,
  which impedes further advances. In this article, we review recent
  developments in recommender systems and discuss the major challenges. We
  compare and evaluate available algorithms and examine their roles in the
  future developments. In addition to algorithms, physical aspects are
  described to illustrate macroscopic behavior of recommender systems.
  Potential impacts and future directions are discussed. We emphasize that
  recommendation has great scientific depth and combines diverse research
  fields which makes it interesting for physicists as well as interdisciplinary
  researchers.%

    Augment the training data has a significant effect for deep learning on
  small-scale dataset. For practical semantic segmentation applications, it is
  a hard work to collect and annotate enough training data for training the
  deep neural network. In this paper, we focus on which data augmentation (DA)
  method is better, and what combination of different DA methods can improve
  the network performance more. Our target application is highland AI-Ranch
  which is hard to collect many training data. We firstly collect and produce a
  small-scale open source of sheep segmentation dataset including hundreds
  images, referred to as SSG dataset. Seven frequently used data augmentation
  methods are evaluated, including global augmentation (augment for the whole
  image) such as flipping, and local augmentation (augment only for the region
  of interest) such as cropping, etc. Especially, a novel image compression
  global DA method is proposed which can achieve the best augmentation
  performance in global methods. Furthermore, we explore the performance of the
  cross-combination data augmentation technique when applying to a small-scale
  semantic segmentation dataset. As different DA method will cover the
  different sample distribution, more augmentation fed more good training data
  and meanwhile more bad training data to the network. Therefore, too much
  augmentation may pull down the performance sometimes. Experiment results show
  that the combination of compression, cropping and local shift can achieve the
  best augmentation performance for our AI-Ranch application, the average
  coverage mean-IoU improve from 73.3{\%} to 91.3{\%}, even better than the
  combination of whole augmentation methods.%

    Abstract Relationship marketing assumes that firms can be more profitable
  if they identify the most profitable customers and invest disproportionate
  marketing resources in them. While intuitive, such strategies presume that a
  firm can accurately predict the future profitability of customers. In
  particular, we argue that the feasibility of such strategies depends on the
  probabilities and costs of misclassifying customers. This paper presents a
  detailed empirical evaluation of how accurately the future profitability of
  customers can be estimated. We evaluate a firm's ability to estimate the
  future value of customers using four data sets from different industries.
  Out-of-sample estimates of predictive accuracy are provided. We examine (1)
  the accuracy of predictions, (2) how accuracy depends on the length of time
  over which estimates are made, and (3) the predictors of the firm's best
  customers. We propose the 20–55 and 80–15 rules. Of the top 20{\%},
  approximately 55{\%} will be misclassified (and not receive special
  treatment). Of the future bottom 80{\%}, approximately 15{\%} will be
  misclassified (and receive special treatment). Thus, a firm cannot assume
  that high-profit customers in the past will be profitable in the future nor
  can they assume that historically low-profit will be low-profit customers in
  the future.%

    This paper describes a formulation of reinforcement learning that enables
  learning in noisy, dynamic environments such as in the complex concurrent
  multi-robot learning domain. The methodology involves minimizing the learning

  credit assignment problem through shaped reinforcement in the form of
  heterogeneous reinforcement functions and progress estimators. We
  experimentally validate the approach on a group of four mobile robots
  learning a foraging task.%

    Publisher Summary Connectionist networks in which information is stored in
  weights on connections among simple processing units have attracted
  considerable interest in cognitive science. Much of the interest centers
  around two characteristics of these networks. First, the weights on
  connections between units need not be prewired by the model builder but
  rather may be established through training in which items to be learned are
  presented repeatedly to the network and the connection weights are adjusted
  in small increments according to a learning algorithm. Second, the networks
  may represent information in a distributed fashion. This chapter discusses
  the catastrophic interference in connectionist networks. Distributed
  representations established through the application of learning algorithms
  have several properties that are claimed to be desirable from the standpoint
  of modeling human cognition. These properties include content-addressable
  memory and so-called automatic generalization in which a network trained on a
  set of items responds correctly to other untrained items within the same
  domain. New learning may interfere catastrophically with old learning when
  networks are trained sequentially. The analysis of the causes of interference
  implies that at least some interference will occur whenever new learning may
  alter weights involved in representing old learning, and the simulation
  results demonstrate only that interference is catastrophic in some specific
  networks.%

    Packet header traces are widely used in network analysis. Header traces are
  the aggregate of traffic from many concurrent applications. We present a
  methodology, based on machine learning, that can break the trace down into
  clusters of traffic where each cluster has different traffic characteristics.
  Typical clusters include bulk transfer, single and multiple transactions and
  interactive traffic, amongst others. The paper includes a description of the
  methodology, a visualisation of the attribute statistics that aids in
  recognising cluster types and a discussion of the stability and effectiveness
  of the methodology.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    With the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and
  applications in our everyday lives, accounting for fairness has gained
  significant importance in designing and engineering of such systems. AI
  systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and
  life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions
  do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations.
  More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning
  and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With
  the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware
  of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to
  address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world
  applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different
  sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy
  for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to
  avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined
  different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed
  with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and ways they
  have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and
  solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We
  are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues
  in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.%

    In this paper we report the set-up and results of the Multimodal Brain
  Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS) organized in conjunction with the
  MICCAI 2012 and 2013 conferences. Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation
  algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low- and
  high-grade glioma patients-manually annotated by up to four raters-and to 65
  comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software.
  Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human
  raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range
  74{\%}-85{\%}), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that
  different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching
  performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single
  algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing
  several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded
  segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms,
  indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements.
  The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available
  through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.%

    A multiple linear regression (MLR) model, in conjunction with Geographic
  Information Systems technology, was used to derive the relationship between
  annual precipitation and elevation, longitude, and latitude. The island of
  Crete, in Greece, was used as the case study. A multiscale precipitation
  analysis was performed on areas ranging from large areas (the whole island
  and the northern, southern, and eastern parts of the island), to medium areas
  (watersheds), to small areas (sub-basins). While the MLR annual precipitation
  estimates (which used elevation, latitude, and longitude information) were
  found to be more reasonable than estimates obtained using elevation only when
  applied to the whole island, the difference between the MLR estimates and the
  elevation-only estimates was smaller when applied to individual watersheds.
  The MLR provides realistic estimates for mean areal precipitation for the
  island of Crete: 700±100, 950±150, and 1,300±200 mm for dry, average, and
  wet years, respectively. Elevation-rainfall gradients are: 0.45–0.6,
  0.6–0.9, and 0.9–1.3 mm/m for dry, average, and wet years, respectively.
  Of this, 44{\%} falls on the northern, 33{\%} on the southern, and 23{\%} on
  the eastern parts of the island for a typical average year.%

    This paper presents the techniques employed in our team's submissions to
  the 2015 Emotion Recognition in the Wild contest, for the sub-challenge of
  Static Facial Expression Recognition in the Wild. The objective of this
  sub-challenge is to classify the emotions expressed by the primary human
  subject in static images extracted from movies. We follow a transfer learning
  approach for deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. Starting
  from a network pre-trained on the generic ImageNet dataset, we perform
  supervised fine-tuning on the network in a two-stage process, first on
  datasets relevant to facial expressions, followed by the contest's dataset.
  Experimental results show that this cascading fine-tuning approach achieves
  better results, compared to a single stage fine-tuning with the combined
  datasets. Our best submission exhibited an overall accuracy of 48.5{\%} in
  the validation set and 55.6{\%} in the test set, which compares favorably to
  the respective 35.96{\%} and 39.13{\%} of the challenge baseline.%

    Attention has arguably become one of the most important concepts in the
  deep learning field. It is inspired by the biological systems of humans that
  tend to focus on the distinctive parts when processing large amounts of
  information. With the development of deep neural networks, attention
  mechanism has been widely used in diverse application domains. This paper
  aims to give an overview of the state-of-the-art attention models proposed in
  recent years. Toward a better general understanding of attention mechanisms,
  we define a unified model that is suitable for most attention structures.
  Each step of the attention mechanism implemented in the model is described in
  detail. Furthermore, we classify existing attention models according to four
  criteria: the softness of attention, forms of input feature, input
  representation, and output representation. Besides, we summarize network
  architectures used in conjunction with the attention mechanism and describe
  some typical applications of attention mechanism. Finally, we discuss the
  interpretability that attention brings to deep learning and present its
  potential future trends.%

    A mobile agent with the task to classify its sensor pattern has to cope
  with ambiguous information. Active recognition of three-dimensional objects
  involves the observer in a search for discriminative evidence, e.g., by
  change of its viewpoint. This paper defines the recognition process as a
  sequential decision problem with the objective to disambiguate initial object
  hypotheses. Reinforcement learning provides then an efficient method to
  autonomously develop near-optimal decision strategies in terms of
  sensorimotor mappings. The proposed system learns object models from visual
  appearance and uses a radial basis function (RBF) network for a probabilistic
  interpretation of the two-dimensional views. The information gain in fusing
  successive object hypotheses provides a utility measure to reinforce actions
  leading to discriminative viewpoints. The system is verified in experiments
  with 16 objects and two degrees of freedom in sensor motion. Crucial
  improvements in performance are gained using the learned in contrast to
  random camera placements.%

    This paper presents the design of a fully deployed multistage transfer
  learning system for targeted display advertising, highlighting the important
  role of problem formulation and the sampling of data from distributions
  different from that of the target environment. Notably, the machine learning
  system itself is deployed and has been in continual use for years for
  thousands of advertising campaigns---in contrast to the more common case
  where predictive models are built outside the system, curated, and then
  deployed. In this domain, acquiring sufficient data for training from the
  ideal sampling distribution is prohibitively expensive. Instead, data are
  drawn from surrogate distributions and learning tasks, and then transferred
  to the target task. We present the design of the transfer learning system We
  then present a detailed experimental evaluation, showing that the different
  transfer stages indeed each add value. We also present production results
  across a variety of advertising clients from a variety of industries,
  illustrating the performance of the system in use. We close the paper with a
  collection of lessons learned from over half a decade of research and
  development on this complex, deployed, and intensely used machine learning
  system.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Automated segmentation of tuberculosis (TB)-consistent lesions in chest
  X-rays (CXRs) using deep learning (DL) methods can help reduce radiologist
  effort, supplement clinical decision-making, and potentially result in
  improved patient treatment. The majority of works in the literature discuss
  training automatic segmentation models using coarse bounding box annotations.
  However, the granularity of the bounding box annotation could result in the
  inclusion of a considerable fraction of false positives and negatives at the
  pixel level that may adversely impact overall semantic segmentation
  performance. This study evaluates the benefits of using fine-grained
  annotations of TB-consistent lesions toward training the variants of U-Net
  models and constructing their ensembles for semantically segmenting
  TB-consistent lesions in both original and bone-suppressed frontal CXRs. The
  segmentation performance is evaluated using several ensemble methods such as
  bitwise- AND, bitwise-OR, bitwise-MAX, and stacking. Extensive empirical
  evaluations showcased that the stacking ensemble demonstrated superior
  segmentation performance (Dice score: 0.5743, 95{\%} confidence interval:
  (0.4055, 0.7431)) compared to the individual constituent models and other
  ensemble methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
  apply ensemble learning to improve fine-grained TB-consistent lesion
  segmentation performance.%

    Automated brain lesion detection is an important and very challenging
  clinical diagnostic task, due to the lesions'different sizes, shapes,
  contrasts, and locations. Recently deep learning has shown promising
  progresses in many application fields, thereby motivating us to apply this
  technique for such an important problem. In this paper, we propose an
  automatic end-to-end trainable architecture for heterogeneous brain tumor
  segmentation through adversarial training for the BraTS-2017 challenge.
  Inspired by classical generative adversarial network, the proposed network
  has two components: the ``Discriminator'' and the ``Generator''. We use a
  patient-wise fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) as the segmentor
  network to generate segmentation label maps. The discriminator network is
  patient-wise fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) with L1 loss that
  discriminates segmentation maps coming from the ground truth or from the
  segmentor network. We propose an end-to-end trainable CNNs for survival day
  prediction based on deep learning techniques. The experimental results
  demonstrate the ability of the propose approaches for both tasks of
  BraTS-2017 challenge. Our patient-wise cGAN achieved competitive results in
  the BraTS-2017 challenges.%

    Medical image annotation is a major hurdle for developing precise and
  robust machine-learning models. Annotation is expensive, time-consuming, and
  often requires expert knowledge, particularly in the medical field. Here, we
  suggest using minimal user interaction in the form of extreme point clicks to
  train a segmentation model which, in effect, can be used to speed up medical
  image annotation. An initial segmentation is generated based on the extreme
  points using the random walker algorithm. This initial segmentation is then
  used as a noisy supervision signal to train a fully convolutional network
  that can segment the organ of interest, based on the provided user clicks.
  Through experimentation on several medical imaging datasets, we show that the
  predictions of the network can be refined using several rounds of training
  with the prediction from the same weakly annotated data. Further improvements
  are shown using the clicked points within a custom-designed loss and
  attention mechanism. Our approach has the potential to speed up the process
  of generating new training datasets for the development of new
  machine-learning and deep-learning-based models for, but not exclusively,
  medical image analysis.%

    In this article, we describe a method for optimizing control policies, with
  guaranteed monotonic improvement. By making several approximations to the
  theoretically-justified scheme, we develop a practical algorithm, called
  Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). This algorithm is effective for
  optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural networks. Our experiments
  demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning
  simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari
  games using images of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that
  deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with
  little tuning of hyperparameters.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Deep learning increasingly accelerates biomedical research, deploying
  neural networks for multiple tasks, such as image classification, object
  detection, and semantic segmentation. However, neural networks are commonly
  trained supervised on large-scale, labeled datasets. These prerequisites
  raise issues in biomedical image recognition, as datasets are generally
  small-scale, challenging to obtain, expensive to label, and frequently
  heterogeneously labeled. Furthermore, heterogeneous labels are a challenge
  for supervised methods. If not all classes are labeled for an individual
  sample, supervised deep learning approaches can only learn on a subset of the
  dataset with common labels for each individual sample; consequently,
  biomedical image recognition engineers need to be frugal concerning their
  label and ground truth requirements. This paper discusses the effects of
  frugal labeling and proposes to train neural networks for multi-class
  semantic segmentation on heterogeneously labeled data based on a novel
  objective function. The objective function combines a class asymmetric loss
  with the Dice loss. The approach is demonstrated for training on the sparse
  ground truth of a heterogeneous labeled dataset, training within a transfer
  learning setting, and the use-case of merging multiple heterogeneously
  labeled datasets. For this purpose, a biomedical small-scale, multi-class
  semantic segmentation dataset is utilized. The heartSeg dataset is based on
  the medaka fish’s position as a cardiac model system. Automating image
  recognition and semantic segmentation enables high-throughput experiments and
  is essential for biomedical research. Our approach and analysis show
  competitive results in supervised training regimes and encourage frugal
  labeling within biomedical image recognition.%

    Active learning methods select informative instances to effectively learn a
  suitable classifier. Uncertainty sampling, a frequently utilized active
  learning strategy, selects instances about which the model is uncertain but
  it does not consider the reasons for why the model is uncertain. In this
  article, we present an evidence-based framework that can uncover the reasons
  for why a model is uncertain on a given instance. Using the evidence-based
  framework, we discuss two reasons for uncertainty of a model: a model can be
  uncertain about an instance because it has strong, but conflicting evidence
  for both classes or it can be uncertain because it does not have enough
  evidence for either class. Our empirical evaluations on several real-world
  datasets show that distinguishing between these two types of uncertainties
  has a drastic impact on the learning efficiency. We further provide empirical
  and analytical justifications as to why distinguishing between the two
  uncertainties matters.%

    Abstract The ongoing changes in vegetation spring phenology in
  temperate/cold regions are widely attributed to temperature. However, in
  arid/semiarid ecosystems, the correlation between spring temperature and
  phenology is much less clear. We test the hypothesis that precipitation plays
  an important role in the temperature dependency of phenology in arid/semiarid
  regions. We therefore investigated the influence of preseason precipitation
  on satellite-derived estimates of starting date of vegetation growing season
  (SOS) across the Tibetan Plateau (TP). We observed two clear patterns linking
  precipitation to SOS. First, SOS is more sensitive to interannual variations
  in preseason precipitation in more arid than in wetter areas. Spatially, an
  increase in long-term averaged preseason precipitation of 10 mm corresponds
  to a decrease in the precipitation sensitivity of SOS by about
  0.01 day mm−1. Second, SOS is more sensitive to variations in preseason
  temperature in wetter than in dryer areas of the plateau. A spatial increase
  in precipitation of 10 mm corresponds to an increase in temperature
  sensitivity of SOS of 0.25 day °C−1 (0.25 day SOS advance per 1 °C
  temperature increase). Those two patterns indicate both direct and indirect
  impacts of precipitation on SOS on TP. This study suggests a balance between
  maximizing benefit from the limiting climatic resource and minimizing the
  risk imposed by other factors. In wetter areas, the lower risk of drought
  allows greater temperature sensitivity of SOS to maximize the thermal
  benefit, which is further supported by the weaker interannual partial
  correlation between growing degree days and preseason precipitation. In more
  arid areas, maximizing the benefit of water requires greater sensitivity of
  SOS to precipitation, with reduced sensitivity to temperature. This study
  highlights the impacts of precipitation on SOS in a large cold and
  arid/semiarid region and suggests that influences of water should be included
  in SOS module of terrestrial ecosystem models for drylands.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many
  Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big
  data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a
  network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model
  the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access
  to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data
  Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data
  Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and
  quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be
  built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey
  include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters,
  mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial
  training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and
  meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are
  heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this
  paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as
  test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum
  learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation,
  promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data
  Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the
  performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of
  the capabilities of big data.%

    Computers can beat humans at increasingly complex games, including chess
  and Go. However, these programs are typically constructed for a particular
  game, exploiting its properties, such as the symmetries of the board on which
  it is played. Silver et al. developed a program called AlphaZero, which
  taught itself to play Go, chess, and shogi (a Japanese version of chess) (see
  the Editorial, and the Perspective by Campbell). AlphaZero managed to beat
  state-of-the-art programs specializing in these three games. The ability of
  AlphaZero to adapt to various game rules is a notable step toward achieving a
  general game-playing system. Science, this issue p. 1140; see also pp. 1087
  and 1118 AlphaZero teaches itself to play three different board games and
  beats state-of-the-art programs in each. The game of chess is the
  longest-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The
  strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search
  techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions
  that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast,
  the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game
  of Go by reinforcement learning from self-play. In this paper, we generalize
  this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman

    Health forecasting is a novel area of forecasting, and a valuable tool for
  predicting future health events or situations such as demands for health
  services and healthcare needs. It facilitates preventive medicine and health
  care intervention strategies, by pre-informing health service providers to
  take appropriate mitigating actions to minimize risks and manage demand.
  Health forecasting requires reliable data, information and appropriate
  analytical tools for the prediction of specific health conditions or
  situations. There is no single approach to health forecasting, and so various
  methods have often been adopted to forecast aggregate or specific health
  conditions. Meanwhile, there are no defined health forecasting horizons (time
  frames) to match the choices of health forecasting methods/approaches that
  are often applied. The key principles of health forecasting have not also
  been adequately described to guide the process. This paper provides a brief
  introduction and theoretical analysis of health forecasting. It describes the
  key issues that are important for health forecasting, including: definitions,
  principles of health forecasting, and the properties of health data, which
  influence the choices of health forecasting methods. Other matters related to
  the value of health forecasting, and the general challenges associated with
  developing and using health forecasting services are discussed. This overview
  is a stimulus for further discussions on standardizing health forecasting
  approaches and methods that will facilitate health care and health services
  delivery.%

    Diabetic retinopathy is the most frequently occurring complication of
  diabetes mellitus and remains a leading cause of vision loss globally. Its
  aetiology and pathology have been extensively studied for half a century, yet
  there are disappointingly few therapeutic options. Although some new
  treatments have been introduced for diabetic macular oedema (DMO) (e.g.
  intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (anti-VEGFs) and
  new steroids), up to 50{\%} of patients fail to respond. Furthermore, for
  people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), laser photocoagulation
  remains a mainstay therapy, even though it is an inherently destructive
  procedure. This review summarises the clinical features of diabetic
  retinopathy and its risk factors. It describes details of retinal pathology
  and how advances in our understanding of pathogenesis have led to
  identification of new therapeutic targets. We emphasise that although there
  have been significant advances, there is still a pressing need for a better
  understanding basic mechanisms enable development of reliable and robust
  means to identify patients at highest risk, and to intervene effectively
  before vision loss occurs.%

    Univariate ANOVA is reviewed from a user point-of-view with emphasis on
  understanding the model building and the assumptions underlying the method.
  Illustrative examples are taken from organic chemistry and analytical
  chemistry. The use of graphical techniques to visualize the ANOVA model as
  well as to analyse residuals is recommended. The main models of ANOVA are
  developed in some detail including one-factor ANOVA, crossed designs, nested
  designs, repeated measures ANOVA and variance components estimation.
  Hypothesis testing by F-tests-and follow up by pairwise comparison methods is
  shown. The distinction between random effects and fixed effects is explained.
  Methods to handle non-linearities by transformations or by using response
  surface methodology are mentioned. Throughout the paper the importance of
  experimental design is emphasized. References are given to ANOVA methods for
  more complicated models.%

    In this article, we present a multispecies reaction--advection--diffusion
  partial differential equation coupled with linear elasticity for modeling
  tumor growth. The model aims to capture the phenomenological features of
  glioblastoma multiforme observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.
  These include enhancing and necrotic tumor structures, brain edema and the
  so-called ``mass effect'', a term-of-art that refers to the deformation of
  brain tissue due to the presence of the tumor. The multispecies model
  accounts for proliferating, invasive and necrotic tumor cells as well as a
  simple model for nutrition consumption and tumor-induced brain edema. The
  coupling of the model with linear elasticity equations with variable
  coefficients allows us to capture the mechanical deformations due to the
  tumor growth on surrounding tissues. We present the overall formulation along
  with a novel operator-splitting scheme with components that include
  linearly-implicit preconditioned elliptic solvers, and a semi-Lagrangian
  method for advection. We also present results showing simulated MRI images
  which highlight the capability of our method to capture the overall structure
  of glioblastomas in MRIs.%

    The presence of a bias in each image data collection has recently attracted
  a lot of attention in the computer vision community showing the limits in
  generalization of any learning method trained on a specific dataset. At the
  same time, with the rapid development of deep learning architectures, the
  activation values of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are emerging as
  reliable and robust image descriptors. In this chapter we propose to verify
  the potential of the CNN features when facing the dataset biasDataset
  biasproblem. With this purpose we introduce a large testbed for cross-dataset
  analysis and we discuss the challenges faced to create two comprehensive
  experimental setups by aligning twelve existing image databases. We conduct a
  series of analyses looking at how the datasets differ among each other and
  verifying the performance of existing debiasing methods under different
  representations. We learn important lessons on which part of the dataset bias
  problem can be considered solved and which open questions still need to be
  tackled.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In the typical nonparametric approach to classification in instance-based
  learning and data mining, random data (the training set of patterns) are
  collected and used to design a decision rule (classifier). One of the most
  well known such rules is the k-nearest-neighbor decision rule (also known as
  lazy learning) in which an unknown pattern is classified into the majority
  class among its k nearest neighbors in the training set. Several questions
  related to this rule have received considerable attention over the years.
  Such questions include the following. How can the storage of the training set
  be reduced without degrading the performance of the decision rule? How should
  the reduced training set be selected to represent the different classes? How
  large should k be? How should the value of k be chosen? Should all k
  neighbors be equally weighted when used to decide the class of an unknown
  pattern? If not, how should the weights be chosen? Should all the features
  (attributes) we weighted equally and if not how should the feature weights be
  chosen? What distance metric should be used? How can the rule be made robust
  to overlapping classes or noise present in the training data? How can the
  rule be made invariant to scaling of the measurements? How can the nearest
  neighbors of a new point be computed efficiently? What is the smallest neural
  network that can implement nearest neighbor decision rules? Geometric
  proximity graphs such as Voronoi diagrams and their many relatives provide
  elegant solutions to these problems, as well as other related data mining
  problems such as outlier detection. After a non-exhaustive review of some of
  the classical canonical approaches to these problems, the methods that use
  proximity graphs are discussed, some new observations are made, and open
  problems are listed.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Disease risk prediction is a rising challenge in the medical domain.
  Researchers have widely used machine learning algorithms to solve this
  challenge. The k-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm is the most frequently
  used among the wide range of machine learning algorithms. This paper presents
  a study on different KNN variants (Classic one, Adaptive, Locally adaptive,
  k-means clustering, Fuzzy, Mutual, Ensemble, Hassanat and Generalised mean
  distance) and their performance comparison for disease prediction. This study
  analysed these variants in-depth through implementations and experimentations
  using eight machine learning benchmark datasets obtained from Kaggle, UCI
  Machine learning repository and OpenML. The datasets were related to
  different disease contexts. We considered the performance measures of
  accuracy, precision and recall for comparative analysis. The average accuracy
  values of these variants ranged from 64.22{\%} to 83.62{\%}. The Hassanaat
  KNN showed the highest average accuracy (83.62{\%}), followed by the ensemble
  approach KNN (82.34{\%}). A relative performance index is also proposed based
  on each performance measure to assess each variant and compare the results.
  This study identified Hassanat KNN as the best performing variant based on
  the accuracy-based version of this index, followed by the ensemble approach
  KNN. This study also provided a relative comparison among KNN variants based
  on precision and recall measures. Finally, this paper summarises which KNN
  variant is the most promising candidate to follow under the consideration of
  three performance measures (accuracy, precision and recall) for disease
  prediction. Healthcare researchers and stakeholders could use the findings of
  this study to select the appropriate KNN variant for predictive disease risk
  analytics.%

    In this paper, we analyze and predict the temperature and humidity using
  IoT and linear regression algorithm in machine learning. In ancient days,
  people use to check the climate conditions by seeing clouds or through storm
  warnings or by using animals they have noticed the weather conditions for
  many purposes like harvesting and involves many household activities. To
  overcome this situation, weather forecasting was found. We collect the
  temperature and humidity data in various places for few days using Message
  Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. So, we initialize the collected
  data for 5 days in Amazon Web services (AWS) cloud. This data is stored in
  AWS and by using Dynamo Database (DynamoDB) the stored data is created in the
  form of the table and it is exported to .csv file. Hence, the data is
  recorded. Now by using linear regression algorithm in machine learning, we
  predict the temperature and humidity data. People can therefore easily
  monitor the weather conditions without eagerly waiting for tomorrow. This
  makes more easy and comfortable way to the people so that they will be able
  to know the climatic conditions within a short period of time.%

    In this work, we present a review of the state of the art of
  information-theoretic feature selection methods. The concepts of feature
  relevance, redundance, and complementarity (synergy) are clearly defined, as
  well as Markov blanket. The problem of optimal feature selection is defined.
  A unifying theoretical framework is described, which can retrofit successful
  heuristic criteria, indicating the approximations made by each method. A
  number of open problems in the field are presented.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Jaccard index, originally proposed by Jaccard (Bull Soc Vaudoise Sci Nat
  37:241--272, 1901), is a measure for examining the similarity (or
  dissimilarity) between two sample data objects. It is defined as the
  proportion of the intersection size to the union size of the two data
  samples. It provides a very simple and intuitive measure of similarity
  between data samples. This research examines the measures that are akin to
  the Jaccard index and may be used for modelling affinity between users (or
  items) in collaborative recommendations. Particularly, the measures such as
  simple matching coefficient (SMC), Sorensen--Dice coefficient (SDC), Salton's
  cosine index (SCI), and overlap coefficient (OLC) are compared and analysed
  in both theoretical and empirical perspectives with respect to the Jaccard
  index. Since these measures apprehend only the structural similarity
  information (overlapping information) between the data samples, these are
  very useful in situations where only the associations between users and items
  are available such as browsing or buying behaviours of the users on an
  e-commerce portal (i.e. unary rating data, a special case of ratings).
  Furthermore, a theoretical relation among these measures has been
  established. We have also derived an equivalent expression for each of these
  measures so that it can be directly applied for binary data samples in data
  mining/machine learning jargon. In order to compare and validate the
  effectiveness of these structural similarity measures, several experiments
  have been conducted using standardized benchmark datasets (MovieLens,
  FilmTrust, Epinions, Yahoo! Movies, and Yahoo! Music). Empirically obtained
  results demonstrate that the Salton's cosine index (SCI) provides better
  accuracy (in terms of MAE, RMSE, and precision) for large datasets, whereas
  the overlap coefficient (OLC) results in more accurate recommendations for
  small datasets.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Mapping functional neural circuits for many behaviors has been almost
  impossible, so Vogelstein et al. (p. 386, published online 27 March; see the
  Perspective by O'Leary and Marder) developed a broadly applicable optogenetic
  method for neuron-behavior mapping and used it to phenotype larval Drosophila
  and thus developed a reference atlas. As optogenetic experiments become
  routine in certain fields of neuroscience research, creating even more
  specialized tools is imperative (see the Perspective by Hayashi). By
  engineering channelrhodopsin, Wietek et al. (p. 409, published online 27
  March) and Berndt et al. (p. 420) created two different light-gated anion
  channels to block action potential generation during synaptic stimulation or
  depolarizing current injections. These new tools not only improve
  understanding of channelrhodopsins but also provide a way to silence cells.
  An atlas is generated to reveal activation of which specific neurons in a
  Drosophila larva produce specific behaviors. [Also see Perspective by O'Leary
  and Marder] A single nervous system can generate many distinct motor
  patterns. Identifying which neurons and circuits control which behaviors has
  been a laborious piecemeal process, usually for one observer-defined behavior
  at a time. We present a fundamentally different approach to neuron-behavior
  mapping. We optogenetically activated 1054 identified neuron lines in
  Drosophila larvae and tracked the behavioral responses from 37,780 animals.
  Application of multiscale unsupervised structure learning methods to the
  behavioral data enabled us to identify 29 discrete, statistically
  distinguishable, observer-unbiased behavioral phenotypes. Mapping the neural
  lines to the behavior(s) they evoke provides a behavioral reference atlas for
  neuron subsets covering a large fraction of larval neurons. This atlas is a
  starting point for connectivity- and activity-mapping studies to further
  investigate the mechanisms by which neurons mediate diverse behaviors.%

    Learning effective feature representations and similarity measures are
  crucial to the retrieval performance of a content-based image retrieval
  (CBIR) system. Despite extensive research efforts for decades, it remains one
  of the most challenging open problems that considerably hinders the successes
  of real-world CBIR systems. The key challenge has been attributed to the
  well-known ``semantic gap'' issue that exists between low-level image pixels
  captured by machines and high-level semantic concepts perceived by human.
  Among various techniques, machine learning has been actively investigated as
  a possible direction to bridge the semantic gap in the long term. Inspired by
  recent successes of deep learning techniques for computer vision and other
  applications, in this paper, we attempt to address an open problem: if deep
  learning is a hope for bridging the semantic gap in CBIR and how much
  improvements in CBIR tasks can be achieved by exploring the state-of-the-art
  deep learning techniques for learning feature representations and similarity
  measures. Specifically, we investigate a framework of deep learning with
  application to CBIR tasks with an extensive set of empirical studies by
  examining a state-of-the-art deep learning method (Convolutional Neural
  Networks) for CBIR tasks under varied settings. From our empirical studies,
  we find some encouraging results and summarize some important insights for
  future research.%

    In recent years, crowd counting in still images has attracted many research
  interests due to its applications in public safety. However, it remains a
  challenging task for reasons of perspective and scale variations. In this
  paper, we propose an effective Skip-connection Convolutional Neural Network
  (SCNN) for crowd counting to overcome the issue of scale variations. The
  proposed SCNN architecture consists of several multi-scale units to extract
  multi-scale features. Each multi-scale unit including three convolutional
  layers builds connections between the input and each convolutional layer. In
  addition, we propose a scale-related training method to improve the accuracy
  and robustness of crowd counting. We evaluate our method on three crowd
  counting benchmarks. Experimental results verify the efficiency of the
  proposed method, and it achieves superior performance compared with other
  methods.%

    Deep domain adaptation has emerged as a new learning technique to address
  the lack of massive amounts of labeled data. Compared to conventional
  methods, which learn shared feature subspaces or reuse important source
  instances with shallow representations, deep domain adaptation methods
  leverage deep networks to learn more transferable representations by
  embedding domain adaptation in the pipeline of deep learning. There have been
  comprehensive surveys for shallow domain adaptation, but few timely reviews
  the emerging deep learning based methods. In this paper, we provide a
  comprehensive survey of deep domain adaptation methods for computer vision
  applications with four major contributions. First, we present a taxonomy of
  different deep domain adaptation scenarios according to the properties of
  data that define how two domains are diverged. Second, we summarize deep
  domain adaptation approaches into several categories based on training loss,
  and analyze and compare briefly the state-of-the-art methods under these
  categories. Third, we overview the computer vision applications that go
  beyond image classification, such as face recognition, semantic segmentation
  and object detection. Fourth, some potential deficiencies of current methods
  and several future directions are highlighted.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In this paper, we present a Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for
  fully automatic brain tumor segmentation for both high- and low-grade gliomas
  in MRI images. Unlike normal tissues or organs that usually have a fixed
  location or shape, brain tumors with different grades have shown great
  variation in terms of the location, size, structure, and morphological
  appearance. Moreover, the severe data imbalance exists not only between the
  brain tumor and non-tumor tissues, but also among the different sub-regions
  inside brain tumor (e.g., enhancing tumor, necrotic, edema, and non-enhancing
  tumor). Therefore, we introduce a hybrid model to address the challenges in
  the multi-modality multi-class brain tumor segmentation task. First, we
  propose the dynamic focal Dice loss function that is able to focus more on
  the smaller tumor sub-regions with more complex structures during training,
  and the learning capacity of the model is dynamically distributed to each
  class independently based on its training performance in different training
  stages. Besides, to better recognize the overall structure of the brain tumor
  and the morphological relationship among different tumor sub-regions, we
  relax the boundary constraints for the inner tumor regions in coarse-to-fine
  fashion. Additionally, a symmetric attention branch is proposed to highlight
  the possible location of the brain tumor from the asymmetric features caused
  by growth and expansion of the abnormal tissues in the brain. Generally, to
  balance the learning capacity of the model between spatial details and
  high-level morphological features, the proposed model relaxes the constraints
  of the inner boundary and complex details and enforces more attention on the
  tumor shape, location, and the harder classes of the tumor sub-regions. The
  proposed model is validated on the publicly available brain tumor dataset
  from real patients, BRATS 2019. The experimental results reveal that our
  model improves the overall segmentation performance in comparison with the
  state-of-the-art methods, with major progress on the recognition of the tumor
  shape, the structural relationship of tumor sub-regions, and the segmentation
  of more challenging tumor sub-regions, e.g., the tumor core, and enhancing
  tumor.%

    Magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful imaging modality that can provide
  versatile information. However, it has a fundamental challenge that is time
  consuming to acquire images with high quality and high resolution. Reducing
  the scanned measurements can significantly accelerate its speed with the aid
  of the powerful reconstruction methods, which has evolved from linear
  analytic reconstructions to nonlinear iterative ones. The emerging trend in
  this area is replacing human-defined signal models with that learned from
  data. Specifically, from 2016, deep learning has been incorporated into the
  fast MR imaging task, which draws valuable prior knowledge from big datasets
  to facilitate accurate MR image reconstruction from limited measurements.
  Many researchers believed this started a new era of fast MR imaging
  techniques, namely learning reconstruction. This survey aims to review the
  main works in accelerating MR imaging with deep learning and will discuss
  merits, limitations and challenges associated with such methods. Last but not
  least, this paper will provide a starting point for researchers interested in
  contributing to this field by pointing out good tutorial resources,
  state-of-the-art open-source codes and meaningful data sources.%

    Abstract Visual understanding on construction sites by deep learning, such
  as semantic segmentation, is hardly mentioned in the literature due to the
  severe lack of labeled data sets. To resolve this issue, we collect and label
  859 images, including 12 classes of objects in construction activities, from
  different construction sites. We then adopt DeepLabV3+ on this data set with
  modifications. We leverage the Cityscape data set to pretrain the model, and
  then fine-tune it on our collected data set. Moreover, multiple data
  augmentation techniques are utilized to expand the training data set. Our
  model reaches 0.6467 mean intersection over union (mIoU) and 92.62{\%} mean
  pixel accuracy (mPA) in the out-of-sample test with the capability of
  processing over 45 frames per second with a resolution of pixels. In
  addition, we develop a synthetic robotic system integrated with
  red–green–blue (RGB)-depth camera for visual understanding on sites. It
  can detect the depth information of objects and has high potential in
  automated construction and visual surveillance.%

    In recent years there have been many successes of using deep
  representations in reinforcement learning. Still, many of these applications
  use conventional architectures, such as convolutional networks, LSTMs, or
  auto-encoders. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture
  for model-free reinforcement learning. Our dueling network represents two
  separate estimators: one for the state value function and one for the
  state-dependent action advantage function. The main benefit of this factoring
  is to generalize learning across actions without imposing any change to the
  underlying reinforcement learning algorithm. Our results show that this
  architecture leads to better policy evaluation in the presence of many
  similar-valued actions. Moreover, the dueling architecture enables our RL
  agent to outperform the state-of-the-art on the Atari 2600 domain.%

    Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to garner substantial interest in
  medical imaging. The potential applications are vast and include the entirety
  of the medical imaging life cycle from image creation to diagnosis to outcome
  prediction. The chief obstacles to development and clinical implementation of
  AI algorithms include availability of sufficiently large, curated, and
  representative training data that includes expert labeling (eg, annotations).
  Current supervised AI methods require a curation process for data to
  optimally train, validate, and test algorithms. Currently, most research
  groups and industry have limited data access based on small sample sizes from
  small geographic areas. In addition, the preparation of data is a costly and
  time-intensive process, the results of which are algorithms with limited
  utility and poor generalization. In this article, the authors describe
  fundamental steps for preparing medical imaging data in AI algorithm
  development, explain current limitations to data curation, and explore new
  approaches to address the problem of data availability. © RSNA, 2020%

    This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing the
  generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked generalization
  works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s) with respect to a provided
  learning set. This deduction proceeds by generalizing in a second space whose
  inputs are (for example) the guesses of the original generalizers when taught
  with part of the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose
  output is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple
  generalizers, stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated
  version of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than
  cross-validation's crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual
  generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization is
  a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of a generalizer
  which has been trained on a particular learning set and then asked a
  particular question. After introducing stacked generalization and justifying
  its use, this paper presents two numerical experiments. The first
  demonstrates how stacked generalization improves upon a set of separate
  generalizers for the NETtalk task of translating text to phonemes. The second
  demonstrates how stacked generalization improves the performance of a single
  surface-fitter. With the other experimental evidence in the literature, the
  usual arguments supporting cross-validation, and the abstract justifications
  presented in this paper, the conclusion is that for almost any real-world
  generalization problem one should use some version of stacked generalization
  to minimize the generalization error rate. This paper ends by discussing some
  of the variations of stacked generalization, and how it touches on other
  fields like chaos theory.%

    Hyperparameters are important for machine learning algorithms since they
  directly control the behaviors of training algorithms and have a significant
  effect on the performance of machine learning models. Several techniques have
  been developed and successfully applied for certain application domains.
  However, this work demands professional knowledge and expert experience. And
  sometimes it has to resort to the brute-force search. Therefore, if an
  efficient hyperparameter optimization algorithm can be developed to optimize
  any given machine learning method, it will greatly improve the efficiency of
  machine learning. In this paper, we consider building the relationship
  between the performance of the machine learning models and their
  hyperparameters by Gaussian processes. In this way, the hyperparameter tuning
  problem can be abstracted as an optimization problem and Bayesian
  optimization is used to solve the problem. Bayesian optimization is based on
  the Bayesian theorem. It sets a prior over the optimization function and
  gathers the information from the previous sample to update the posterior of
  the optimization function. A utility function selects the next sample point
  to maximize the optimization function. Several experiments were conducted on
  standard test datasets. Experiment results show that the proposed method can
  find the best hyperparameters for the widely used machine learning models,
  such as the random forest algorithm and the neural networks, even
  multi-grained cascade forest under the consideration of time cost.%

    Landslides are a common type of natural disaster that brings great threats
  to the human lives and economic development around the world, especially in
  the Chinese Loess Plateau. Longxian County (Shaanxi Province, China), a
  landslide-prone area located in the southwest part of the Loess Plateau, was
  selected as the study area. The main purpose of this paper is to map
  landslide susceptibility using Alternating decision tree (ADTree) as well as
  GIS-based new ensemble techniques involving ADTree with bootstrap aggregation
  (Bagging) and ADTree with adaptive boosting (AdaBoost). Initially, a
  landslide inventory map was prepared with 171 determined historical
  landslides events in the study area, 120 landslides (70{\%}) were randomly
  selected for training dataset and the remaining 51 landslides (30{\%}) were
  used for validation dataset. Subsequently, eleven landslide conditioning
  factors were considered in the landslide susceptibility mapping. Then, an
  optimization operation on selection of landslide conditioning factors was
  performed using correlation attribute evaluation method and Spearman’s rank
  correlation coefficient. Afterwards, landslide susceptibility maps were
  generated with the three models. Finally, receiver operating characteristic
  (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC) and statistical measures were
  applied to evaluate and validate the performance of the models. The results
  show success rates of the ADTree model, the ADTree with Bagging
  (ADTree-Bagging) model and the ADTree with AdaBoost (ADTree-AdaBoost) model
  were 0.872, 0.917, and 0.984, respectively, while prediction rates of the
  three models were 0.696, 0.752 and 0.787, respectively. In sum, the two
  ensemble models proposed prohibited better performance than the ADTree model
  did, and the ADTree-AdaBoost model was selected as the best model in the
  study. Hence, ensemble techniques can provide new and promising methods for
  spatial prediction and zonation of landslide susceptibility.%

    Automatic segmentation methods are an important advancement in medical
  image analysis. Machine learning techniques, and deep neural networks in
  particular, are the state-of-the-art for most medical image segmentation
  tasks. Issues with class imbalance pose a significant challenge in medical
  datasets, with lesions often occupying a considerably smaller volume relative
  to the background. Loss functions used in the training of deep learning
  algorithms differ in their robustness to class imbalance, with direct
  consequences for model convergence. The most commonly used loss functions for
  segmentation are based on either the cross entropy loss, Dice loss or a
  combination of the two. We propose the Unified Focal loss, a new hierarchical
  framework that generalises Dice and cross entropy-based losses for handling
  class imbalance. We evaluate our proposed loss function on five publicly
  available, class imbalanced medical imaging datasets: CVC-ClinicDB, Digital
  Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), Breast Ultrasound 2017
  (BUS2017), Brain Tumour Segmentation 2020 (BraTS20) and Kidney Tumour
  Segmentation 2019 (KiTS19). We compare our loss function performance against
  six Dice or cross entropy-based loss functions, across 2D binary, 3D binary
  and 3D multiclass segmentation tasks, demonstrating that our proposed loss
  function is robust to class imbalance and consistently outperforms the other
  loss functions. Source code is available at:

    Generative adversarial networks have gained a lot of attention in the
  computer vision community due to their capability of data generation without
  explicitly modelling the probability density function. The adversarial loss
  brought by the discriminator provides a clever way of incorporating unlabeled
  samples into training and imposing higher order consistency. This has proven
  to be useful in many cases, such as domain adaptation, data augmentation, and
  image-to-image translation. These properties have attracted researchers in
  the medical imaging community, and we have seen rapid adoption in many
  traditional and novel applications, such as image reconstruction,
  segmentation, detection, classification, and cross-modality synthesis. Based
  on our observations, this trend will continue and we therefore conducted a
  review of recent advances in medical imaging using the adversarial training
  scheme with the hope of benefiting researchers interested in this technique.%

    Semantic segmentation, also called scene labeling, refers to the process of
  assigning a semantic label (e.g. car, people, and road) to each pixel of an
  image. It is an essential data processing step for robots and other unmanned
  systems to understand the surrounding scene. Despite decades of efforts,
  semantic segmentation is still a very challenging task due to large
  variations in natural scenes. In this paper, we provide a systematic review
  of recent advances in this field. In particular, three categories of methods
  are reviewed and compared, including those based on hand-engineered features,
  learned features and weakly supervised learning. In addition, we describe a
  number of popular datasets aiming for facilitating the development of new
  segmentation algorithms. In order to demonstrate the advantages and
  disadvantages of different semantic segmentation models, we conduct a series
  of comparisons between them. Deep discussions about the comparisons are also
  provided. Finally, this review is concluded by discussing future directions
  and challenges in this important field of research.%

    The Jaccard index, also known as Intersection-over-Union (IoU), is one of
  the most critical evaluation metrics in image semantic segmentation. However,
  direct optimization of IoU score is very difficult because the learning
  objective is neither differentiable nor decomposable. Although some
  algorithms have been proposed to optimize its surrogates, there is no
  guarantee provided for the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose
  a margin calibration method, which can be directly used as a learning
  objective, for an improved generalization of IoU over the data-distribution,
  underpinned by a rigid lower bound. This scheme theoretically ensures a
  better segmentation performance in terms of IoU score. We evaluated the
  effectiveness of the proposed margin calibration method on seven image
  datasets, showing substantial improvements in IoU score over other learning
  objectives using deep segmentation models.%

    The semantic segmentation of remote sensing images (RSIs) is important in a
  variety of applications. Conventional encoder-decoder-based convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs) use cascade pooling operations to aggregate the
  semantic information, which results in a loss of localization accuracy and in
  the preservation of spatial details. To overcome these limitations, we
  introduce the use of the high-resolution network (HRNet) to produce
  high-resolution features without the decoding stage. Moreover, we enhance the
  low-to-high features extracted from different branches separately to
  strengthen the embedding of scale-related contextual information. The
  low-resolution features contain more semantic information and have a small
  spatial size; thus, they are utilized to model the long-term spatial
  correlations. The high-resolution branches are enhanced by introducing an
  adaptive spatial pooling (ASP) module to aggregate more local contexts. By
  combining these context aggregation designs across different levels, the
  resulting architecture is capable of exploiting spatial context at both
  global and local levels. The experimental results obtained on two RSI
  datasets show that our approach significantly improves the accuracy with
  respect to the commonly used CNNs and achieves state-of-the-art performance.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    There is growing interest in applying machine learning techniques in the
  research of materials science. However, although it is recognized that
  materials datasets are typically smaller and sometimes more diverse compared
  to other fields, the influence of availability of materials data on training
  machine learning models has not yet been studied, which prevents the
  possibility to establish accurate predictive rules using small materials
  datasets. Here we analyzed the fundamental interplay between the availability
  of materials data and the predictive capability of machine learning models.
  Instead of affecting the model precision directly, the effect of data size is
  mediated by the degree of freedom (DoF) of model, resulting in the phenomenon
  of association between precision and DoF. The appearance of precision--DoF
  association signals the issue of underfitting and is characterized by large
  bias of prediction, which consequently restricts the accurate prediction in
  unknown domains. We proposed to incorporate the crude estimation of property
  in the feature space to establish ML models using small sized materials data,
  which increases the accuracy of prediction without the cost of higher DoF. In
  three case studies of predicting the band gap of binary semiconductors,
  lattice thermal conductivity, and elastic properties of zeolites, the
  integration of crude estimation effectively boosted the predictive capability
  of machine learning models to state-of-art levels, demonstrating the
  generality of the proposed strategy to construct accurate machine learning
  models using small materials dataset.%

    Machine learning techniques have been widely used in many scientific
  fields, but its use in medical literature is limited partly because of
  technical difficulties. k-nearest neighbors (kNN) is a simple method of
  machine learning. The article introduces some basic ideas underlying the kNN
  algorithm, and then focuses on how to perform kNN modeling with R. The
  dataset should be prepared before running the knn() function in R. After
  prediction of outcome with kNN algorithm, the diagnostic performance of the
  model should be checked. Average accuracy is the mostly widely used statistic
  to reflect the kNN algorithm. Factors such as k value, distance calculation
  and choice of appropriate predictors all have significant impact on the model
  performance.%

    {Supervised learning techniques construct predictive models by learning
  from a large number of training examples, where each training example has a
  label indicating its ground-truth output. Though current techniques have
  achieved great success, it is noteworthy that in many tasks it is difficult
  to get strong supervision information like fully ground-truth labels due to
  the high cost of the data-labeling process. Thus, it is desirable for
  machine-learning techniques to work with weak supervision. This article
  reviews some research progress of weakly supervised learning, focusing on
  three typical types of weak supervision: incomplete supervision, where only a
  subset of training data is given with labels; inexact supervision, where the
  training data are given with only coarse-grained labels; and inaccurate
  supervision, where the given labels are not always ground-truth.}%

    Deep learning methods are a class of machine learning techniques capable of
  identifying highly complex patterns in large datasets. Here, we provide a
  perspective and primer on deep learning applications for genome analysis. We
  discuss successful applications in the fields of regulatory genomics, variant
  calling and pathogenicity scores. We include general guidance for how to
  effectively use deep learning methods as well as a practical guide to tools
  and resources. This primer is accompanied by an interactive online tutorial.%
